You can use your reMarkable 1, reMarkable 2, reMarkable Pro, or Paper Pro Move to write a book.
Pick the size of book you want, and the publisher you wish to use, then you can create a template
to help you stay within certain margins.

This site was first created to help me on my Growth Calculus. One downside (currently) is that
to get a privately generated template loaded onto your tablet requires a third party tool. We
hope the reMarkable team will provide this feature in their software soon.

reMarkable's generally need a SVG or PNG output. But you can also have a PDF and use it as 
a workbook.
